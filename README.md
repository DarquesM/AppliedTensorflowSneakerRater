# AppliedTensorflowSneakerRater

This notebook applies the neural network architecture from Andrew Ng's 2nd Deep Learning Specialization from Coursera on a dataset of scraped sneaker images. Please refer to the Medium post for instructions how to scrape images and adjust the network to suit this classification problem. https://medium.com/p/49475fc75429/edit

In order to use the github repo, please enroll into the Coursera course on "Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization". https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/home/welcome

You can find the "Tensorflow_Tutorial" and "tf_utils.py" in the programming assignments from week 3. Download both notebooks and save them locally. If you're using the code from this repo, please copy and paste the code into the corresponding cells.
